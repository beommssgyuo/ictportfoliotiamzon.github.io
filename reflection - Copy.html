<h1 style="color:#F0B6DC"> MY ICT SECOND QUARTER REFLECTION </h1>
<p style="color:#F0B6DC"> This second quarter in ICT i have learned alot. From learning the basicis of css such as what it is, how it is helpful, and how to use it, to topics in much more detail such as selectors, div, span, link, typography in css, and formatting as well.
Because of these topics, i was able to enhance my knowledge in ICT and expand my learning about how to make a website. Although, i did struggle with parts such as trying to memories or keep in mind the different details such as the properties and values. But, I believe that with more practice and activities such as hands-ons and this reflection I can get better and eventually use these
lessons with ease in creating webpages and in its layouts or formats. I also think that i need improvement in doing these activities so that i could also help myself to improve in the future and understand ICT better. I aim to improve by taking more notes, reviewing the lessons more, and participating in class. As I conclude my reflection, I would like to thank our teacher, Ms. Uminga, For being 
a helpful teacher in ICT and teaching us these topics as well as making our discussions fun and interesting. Also, when we needed the time or if we had an important event coming up, she would allow us to use her time to do it, which lead us to better outcomes. Overall, i enjoyed ICT despite the lack of meetings as i was able to improve myself and my skills this quarter.
